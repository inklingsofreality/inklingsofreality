I didn't know who Jason Gray was until I saw him open for Steven Curtis Chapman some 8 or 9 years ago and I fell in love with his music, particularly the lyrics. They reflect the cries of my heart when I've sinned or going through hard times. That's not easy to say about most modern Christian music with their shallowness. Not so with Jason Gray. Watch the lyric video for his song, **Glory Days** below.
