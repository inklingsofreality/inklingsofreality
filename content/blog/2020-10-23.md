The Dentist sketch is one of the classics of comedy and never gets old. Harvey Korman never could keep a straight face when he worked with Tim Conway. This sketch did come from the Carol Burnett show, which I do not recommend many of the sketches, but most of the ones with Korman and Conway are gold, particularly the "oldest man" sketches. Enjoy a good laugh on this Friday.
